In this repository you will find that there is a "backend" folder and a "frontend" folder.

The backend folder consists of all the cherryPy server that was made for this project.
The frontend folder consists of the frontend which is made in React.

To run this application on a personal computer:

- Clone this repository
- cd into backend and run ```python3 main.py```
- Go to https://intense-stream-77050.herokuapp.com/login
- And login with your username/password and a key


I tried testing on the lab computer and many of the lab computers wouldn't start up or load the terminal properly and the computers that did work, the broadcast/receving would not work despite changing the IP/Port so in this repository I have kept the LISTEN_IP as 0.0.0.0 and the LISTEN_PORT as 1234 so try it on a personal computer as that is recommended.
